Plan and execute the following requirements like an experienced coder.

Core Requirement:
Replace hardcoded dashboard chart data (hardcoded values and cumulative in C:\Users\SRINSHA\Desktop\Lukose\Startup Project\Expense Tracker Tool\ExpenseTrackerTool\family-finance-pwa\src\routes\(app)\dashboard\+page.ts) with real financial data from the transaction data, such as expenses and income. The monthlyData, expenseCategories, waterfallData, should all come from the dynamic data being fed through the transactions and categories sections.
