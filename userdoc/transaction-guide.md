## Clearing Transactions
"Clearing" a transaction indicates you've verified its accuracy against your bank records. To mark as cleared:
1. Open the transaction details
2. Click the "Mark as Cleared" checkbox
3. Confirm the action in the dialog

Cleared transactions:
- Are visually distinguished in the interface
- Are excluded from pending transaction calculations
- Can be reverted to "uncleared" status if needed

## Best Practices
- Clear transactions after monthly bank statement reconciliation
- Use the "Cleared" filter to view only verified transactions
- Regularly review uncleared transactions for accuracy
